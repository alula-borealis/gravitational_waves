## Introduction
This project is aiming to investigate the nature of how gravitational waves scatter off of multiple objects by employing a method of analysing the scattering of scalar and vector waves; the coupled-dipole method. This method will be modified for gravitational waves and compared to scalar and vector wave scattering, ideally looking for if tensor waves produce the coherent back-scattering cone. The project will start by producing code to verify the back-scattering cone for scalar and vector waves, and then build up to developing a code to investigate gravitational waves.
